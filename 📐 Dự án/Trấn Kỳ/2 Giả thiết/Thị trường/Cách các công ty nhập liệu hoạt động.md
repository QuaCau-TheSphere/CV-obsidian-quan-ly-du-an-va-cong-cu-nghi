# How large is the market of text data entry classification/annotation? And how do data entry outsourcing companies work?
In my understanding, structuring unstructured data is a necessary activity in our life. For example, if you want to have a financial report of what you buy this month, you first need to write down your transaction, like `fish 50k`. This is raw, unstructured data. Then at the end of the month you need to label/annotate/classify the data like this:

* Object: `fish`
* Type of Object: `food`
* Place of transaction: `market`
* Type of place of transaction: `offline`
* Consumer: `myself`
* Type of consumer: `myself`
* Price: `50000 VND`

And that's just one piece of input data. Imagine how large the data that specialized companies or projects (medical, law, finance, etc.) need to handle. In my understanding, their options are:

* Have the staffs to do that manually, or
* Have a dedicated data entry clerk role, or
* Outsource that to a data entry company, or
* Outsource that to a data entry freelancer, or
* Outsource the automation task to a freelance programmer, or
* Buy similar solutions from big data or information system companies

Now, I wrote an app to automate this process. Technically ChatGPT can also do this, but its approach is statistical-based, while this app's approach is rule-based. If the raw data is just keywords, then this app is much faster, cheaper and more accurate than ChatGPT.

Anyhow, with this app I guess I can work on multiple data entry jobs at once. So my options are either as a data entry freelancer or an employee of an outsourcing data entry company.

It will be easy as long as the clients only care about the final result. However, I have no insight on outsourcing data entry companies. From what I got, it's likely that they have a dedicated system to manage all data entry tasks. I guess I can only get benefit if:

* They haven't implemented automatic classification system, 
* Raw data from the system can be copy-pasted to outside 
* Resulted data from outside of the system can be copy-pasted into it
* The task they give me is only about classify/annotate text raw data
* I can work online. (Or if I must work offline, then at least there is no overseer observes me, which I guess it's not possible.) 

I've tried to apply to them to gain more insight but haven't got any success. I'm still in my way to look for such company.

In general, do you know how large the market of text data entry keyword detection and classification/annotation currently is? And how do data entry outsourcing companies work?
