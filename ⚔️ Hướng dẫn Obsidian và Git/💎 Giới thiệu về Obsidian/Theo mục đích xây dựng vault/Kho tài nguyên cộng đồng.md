> When I was [diagnosed](https://integralguide.com/50+Permanent+Notes/%F0%9F%92%A1+Terms/Diagnoses/Diagnoses) with [Complex PTSD](https://integralguide.com/50+Permanent+Notes/%F0%9F%92%A1+Terms/Diagnoses/%F0%9F%92%A1+Complex+PTSD), [Anxiety](https://integralguide.com/50+Permanent+Notes/%F0%9F%92%A1+Terms/Diagnoses/%F0%9F%92%A1+Anxiety), [Depression](https://integralguide.com/50+Permanent+Notes/%F0%9F%92%A1+Terms/Diagnoses/%F0%9F%92%A1+Depression), [ADHD](https://integralguide.com/50+Permanent+Notes/%F0%9F%92%A1+Terms/Diagnoses/%F0%9F%92%A1+ADHD), and [OCD](https://integralguide.com/50+Permanent+Notes/%F0%9F%92%A1+Terms/Diagnoses/%F0%9F%A7%AF+Obsessive-Compulsive+Disorder) I wanted clarity, I wanted direction, I wanted tools, and I wanted people to stop trying to sell healing to me. 
> 
> I was dismayed and angry that resources were difficult to find, redundant, compartmentalized, antiquated, contradictory, locked behind a paywall, highly triggering, overlong, full of word-salad, or some combination thereof. 
> 
> I was triggered and re-traumatized by "self-help" books full of trauma stories, YouTube videos and articles that took 25 minutes to explain what could take 5, and the Instagram slot-machine full of contradictory information pulling me back and forth. And if they weren’t triggering, they either monetized my attention or ended with a sales pitch to get the "real secrets." There was little sincerity or lived experience in trauma recovery and I felt exploited, helpless, and alone.
