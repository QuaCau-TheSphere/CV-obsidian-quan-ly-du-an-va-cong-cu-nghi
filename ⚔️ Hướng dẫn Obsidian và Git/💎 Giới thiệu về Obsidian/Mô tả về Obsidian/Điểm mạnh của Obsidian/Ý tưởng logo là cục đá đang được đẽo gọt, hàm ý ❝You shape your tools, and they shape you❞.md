### Sharpen your thinking

Extending the metaphor of obsidian tools, our ambition is for Obsidian to be the tool that helps you think more clearly. As a material, obsidian is shaped using a technique called [knapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapping), chipping off flakes of rock to create sharp edges.

Obsidian aims to help you hone your thoughts and refine your ideas with precision. The new icon represents a practical, user-friendly tool that helps you cut through the clutter and carve out clear ideas.

### You shape your tools, and they shape you

We believe that Obsidian should adapt to your way of thinking, not the other way around. That’s why we focus on making Obsidian highly customizable and extensible, so you can shape it to your unique needs.
