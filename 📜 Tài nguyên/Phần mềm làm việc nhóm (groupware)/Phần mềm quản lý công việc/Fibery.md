1.  Knowledge lives in many tools (Notion, Miro, Canny, Slack, Jira)
2.  Discussions out of context
3.  Customers feedback handling process is poor
4.  Features prioritization process is ad-hoc and mostly based on gut feelings
5.  Connection between features specification and features as work items is weak
