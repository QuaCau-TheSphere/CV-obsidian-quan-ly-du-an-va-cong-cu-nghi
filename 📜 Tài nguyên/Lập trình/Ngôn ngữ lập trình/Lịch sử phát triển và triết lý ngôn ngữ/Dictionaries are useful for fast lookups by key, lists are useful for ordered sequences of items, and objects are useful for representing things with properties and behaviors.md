In Python, an object is an instance of a class. A dictionary is a built-in data type that stores data values in key:value pairs. It is an instance of Python’s dict class1.

Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs and are written with curly brackets1. They are ordered (as of Python version 3.7), changeable and do not allow duplicates1.

On the other hand, objects can have attributes and methods defined by their class. All objects in Python have an attribute __dict__, which is a dictionary object containing all attributes defined for that object itself2.

# dictionary vs object

In Python, an object is an instance of a class. A dictionary is a built-in data type that stores data values in key:value pairs. It is an instance of Python’s dict class.

Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs and are written with curly brackets. They are ordered (as of Python version 3.7), changeable and do not allow duplicates.

On the other hand, objects can have attributes and methods defined by their class. All objects in Python have an attribute __dict__, which is a dictionary object containing all attributes defined for that object itself.

In simple terms, you can think of a dictionary as a collection of keys and values, while an object is something that has properties (attributes) and can do things (methods).

# dictionary vs object eli5

Sure! Think of a dictionary as a box with lots of little compartments inside. Each compartment has a label on it (the key) and something inside it (the value). You can use the label to find the compartment you want and see what’s inside.

An object is like a toy robot. It has different parts (attributes) that you can see and touch, like its arms and legs. It can also do things (methods), like walk or talk.

So, a dictionary is like a box with labeled compartments that hold things, while an object is like a toy robot that has parts and can do things.

Does that help?

# dictionary vs lisst

In Python, a dictionary is a collection of key:value pairs. It is used to store data values like a map. Each key:value pair in a dictionary is separated by a colon, and each key is separated by a comma1.

A list, on the other hand, is a collection of values. It is similar to an array in other languages. Lists can contain different data types and are mutable, meaning they can be changed after they are created1.

In simple terms, you can think of a dictionary as a collection of labeled compartments that hold things, while a list is like a row of boxes that hold things.

# why use dictionary when there are list and object?

Dictionaries are useful when you need to associate values with keys, so you can look them up efficiently (by key) later on. This makes dictionaries a good choice for storing data that can be looked up by a unique key, such as product IDs or usernames.

Lists, on the other hand, are useful when you need an ordered sequence of items and don’t need to look up values by a specific key. They are also useful when you need to store multiple values for the same key.

Objects can have attributes and methods defined by their class. They are useful when you need to represent something with properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods).

In summary, dictionaries are useful for fast lookups by key, lists are useful for ordered sequences of items, and objects are useful for representing things with properties and behaviors.

# does js have dictionary ?

JavaScript does not have a native “dictionary” data type. However, you can use objects in JavaScript to create key-value pairs, which work similarly to dictionaries. You can create an object using the Object keyword or using object literal syntax1.

For example, you can create an empty object using the Object keyword like this:

let dictionary = new Object();
Or you can use object literal syntax to create an empty object like this:

let emptyDictionary = {};
You can also initialize the object with values by adding each value in the format of key: value1.

# why doesn't js have dictionary?

JavaScript does not have a native “dictionary” data type because it already has objects, which can be used to create key-value pairs. Objects in JavaScript are quite flexible and can be used to store data in a similar way to dictionaries. You can use an object to store data using a key-value pair, which allows you to look up and retrieve a specific value.

# why does python need dictionary?

Dictionaries are a useful data structure in Python because they allow for fast lookups by key. This makes them a good choice for storing data that can be looked up by a unique key, such as product IDs or usernames. Dictionaries are also useful for representing relationships between data, where one piece of data is associated with another.

In summary, dictionaries are useful in Python because they provide fast lookups by key and allow for the representation of relationships between data.
