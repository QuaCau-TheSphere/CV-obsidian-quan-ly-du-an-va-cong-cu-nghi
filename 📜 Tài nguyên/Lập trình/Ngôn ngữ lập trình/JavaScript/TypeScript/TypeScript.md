Our cafe serves Coffee and Coffeedrink.

What's Coffeedrink?

It's a kind of tea.

Does it taste like coffee?

Not really.

I guess I'll have some Coffeedrink then.

Oh no, you don't actually _drink_ Coffeedrink. You drink this, it's called Typedrink, and it turns into Coffeedrink once it gets into your stomach.
