It’s tempting to work on mass-audience projects because the scale makes high-impact results more likely. Such projects are often less striking, personal, bloody, etc. than their “weirder” alternatives. They might garner a lot more mass attention but a lot _less_ attention from unusual, singular people. Those people are frequently sources of surprising (and more meaningful) insights and opportunities.
