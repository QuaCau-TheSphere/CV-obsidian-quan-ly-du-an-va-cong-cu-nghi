Khái niệm:: [[Chú ý]]
> But to describe **attention as a “resource”** is to subtly **misconstrue** its **centrality** in our lives. Most other resources on which we rely as individuals—such as food, money, and electricity—are things that facilitate life, and in some cases it’s possible to live without them, at least for a while. **Attention**, on the other hand, just **is life**: your experience of being alive consists of nothing other than the **sum of everything to which you pay attention**. At the end of your life, looking back, whatever compelled your attention from moment to moment is simply what your life will have been. So when you pay attention to something you don’t especially value, it’s not an exaggeration to say that you’re **paying with your life**.
