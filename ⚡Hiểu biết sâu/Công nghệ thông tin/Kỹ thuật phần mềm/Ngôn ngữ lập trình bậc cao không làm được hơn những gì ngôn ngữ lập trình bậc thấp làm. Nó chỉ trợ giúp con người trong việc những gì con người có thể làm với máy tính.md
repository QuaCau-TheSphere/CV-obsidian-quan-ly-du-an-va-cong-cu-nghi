Khái niệm:: 

The point of higher-level languages is not that they can _do more_. Assembly language can already do everything that a computer can do.
Their reason for existing is only ever to assist humans, with human-like memory, perception, speed of thought etc., in creating and maintaining code bases _with fewer errors_. The more aware you are of your own limitations, the more you will appreciate why people invented types, classes, interfaces etc. etc.
