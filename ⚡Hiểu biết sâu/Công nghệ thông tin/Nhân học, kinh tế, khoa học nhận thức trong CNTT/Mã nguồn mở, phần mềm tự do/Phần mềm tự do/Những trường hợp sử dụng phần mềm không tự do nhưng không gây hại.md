Khái niệm:: 
- The program doesn't send any data to the outside. I can check that via its network activity or run it in a sandbox
- My data input is not sensitive and I'm fine if others can read it
- I only get output from the program and don't input anything
- I really need a program to meet my needs, and (a) I can't find any alternative free program, (b) I can't afford to hire a dev to write it for me, (c) I can't find someone willing enough to write for me for free or with an affordable cost, (d) I can't spend time to learn programming and write it for myself
