The exact nature of these connections is rarely explained in full, but this is all for the better, as the reader might eventually interpret connections with their own agendas in mind. This is why the name of the meme must be as inclusive as possible: you never know who your eventual allies might be. “A big part of meme engineering is giving a name that creates a big tent that a lot of people want to be under, a train that takes a lot of people where they want to go,” [writes O’Reilly](http://www.slideshare.net/timoreilly/language-is-a-map-pdf-with-notes). Once the meme has been conceived, the rest of O’Reilly’s empire can step in and help make it real. His conferences, for example, play a crucial role: “When you look at any of our events, there’s ultimately some rewriting of the meme map in each of them. _Web 2.0_ was about distinguishing companies that survived the dotcom bust from those that didn’t. _Strata_ is about defining the new field of data science. _Velocity_ is about making clear that the applications of the web depend on people to keep them running, unlike past generations of software that were simply software artifacts.”
