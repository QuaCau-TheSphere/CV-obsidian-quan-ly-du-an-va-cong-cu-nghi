To maximize the appeal and legitimacy of this new paradigm, O’Reilly had to establish that open source both predated free software and was well on its way to conquering the world—that it had a rich history and a rich future. The first objective he accomplished, in part, by exploiting the ambiguities of the term “open”; the second by framing debate about the Internet around its complex causal connections to open source software.

[![b22_fisher5_globalbrain_308](https://thebaffler.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/b22_fisher5_globalbrain_308.png)](http://www.marksfisher.com/)“Open” allowed O’Reilly to build the largest possible tent for the movement. The language of economics was less alienating than Stallman’s language of ethics; “openness” was the kind of multipurpose term that allowed one to look political while advancing an agenda that had very little to do with politics. [As O’Reilly put it in 2010](http://radar.oreilly.com/2010/04/handicapping-internet-platform-wars.html), “the art of promoting openness is not to make it a moral crusade, but rather to highlight the competitive advantages of openness.” Replace “openness” with any other loaded term—say “human rights”—in this sentence, and it becomes clear that this quest for “openness” was politically toothless from the very outset. What, after all, if your interlocutor doesn’t give a damn about competitive advantages?The term “open source” was not invented by O’Reilly. Christine Peterson, the cofounder of Foresight Institute (a nanotechnology think tank), coined it in a February 1998 brainstorm session convened to react to Netscape’s release of Navigator’s source code. Few words in the English language pack as much ambiguity and sexiness as “open.” And after O’Reilly’s bombastic interventions—“Open allows experimentation. Open encourages competition. Open wins,” [he once proclaimed](http://www.forbes.com/2009/02/22/kindle-oreilly-ebooks-technology-breakthroughs_oreilly.html) in an essay—its luster has only intensified. Profiting from the term’s ambiguity, O’Reilly and his collaborators likened the “openness” of open source software to the “openness” of the academic enterprise, markets, and free speech. “Open” thus could mean virtually anything, from “open to intellectual exchange” ([O’Reilly in 1999](http://web.archive.org/web/20000119094723/http://sunworld.com/sunworldonline/swol-01-1999/swol-01-regex-2.html): “Once you start thinking of computer source code as a human language, you see open source as a variety of ‘free speech’”) to “open to competition” ([O’Reilly in 2000](http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/4179): “For me, ‘open source’ in the broader sense means any system in which open access to code lowers the barriers to entry into the market”).

Unsurprisingly, the availability of source code for universal examination soon became the one and only benchmark of openness. What the code did was of little importance—the market knows best!—as long as anyone could check it for bugs. The new paradigm was presented as something that went beyond ideology and could attract corporate executives without losing its appeal to the hacker crowd. “The implication of [the open source] label is that we intend to convince the corporate world to adopt our way for economic, self-interested, non-ideological reasons,” [Eric Raymond noted in 1998](http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/2918). What Raymond and O’Reilly failed to grasp, or decided to overlook, is that their effort to present open source as non-ideological was underpinned by a powerful ideology of its own—an ideology that worshiped innovation and efficiency at the expense of everything else.

It took a lot of creative work to make the new paradigm stick. One common tactic was to present open source as having a much longer history that even predates 1998. Thus, writing shortly after O’Reilly’s historic open source summit, [Raymond noted that](http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/2918) “the summit was hosted by O’Reilly & Associates, a company that has been symbiotic with the Open Source movement for many years.” That the term “open source” was just a few months old by the time Raymond wrote this didn’t much matter. History was something that clever PR could easily fix. “As we thought about it, we said, gosh, this is also a great PR opportunity—we’re a company that has learned to work the PR angles on things,” [O’Reilly said in 1999](https://books.google.com/books?id=kIU1scm4w6QC&lpg=PA169&ots=XymvERLdeY&dq=%22So%20part%20of%20the%20agenda%20for%20the%20summit%20was%20hey%2C%20just%20to%20meet%20and%20find%20out%20what%20we%20had%20in%20common.%22&pg=PA169#v=onepage&q&f=false). “So part of the agenda for the summit was hey, just to meet and find out what we had in common. And the second agenda was really to make a statement of some kind [that] this was a movement, that all these different programs had something in common.”
