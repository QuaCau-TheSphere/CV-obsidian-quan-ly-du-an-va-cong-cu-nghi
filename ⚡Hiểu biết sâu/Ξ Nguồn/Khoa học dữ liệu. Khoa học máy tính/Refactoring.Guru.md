**Refactoring.Guru** makes it easy for you to discover everything you need to know about refactoring, design patterns, SOLID principles, and other smart programming topics.

This site shows you the big picture, how all these subjects intersect, work together, and are still relevant. I don’t pretend to be the inventor of these concepts—most of them were invented by others during the past 20 years. But I think that the connection between refactoring, patterns and general programming principles still remains a mystery for the majority of programmers. This is the problem I would like to solve here.
