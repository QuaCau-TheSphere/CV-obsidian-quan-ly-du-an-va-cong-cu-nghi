> And it's associated with emotion and it's associated with nature. Whereas. The brain is associated with reason and culture and higher thinking. And we think the body is bad and the brain is good. And we would vary it, and we constantly trying to like control our bodies with like our reason. So there's a clear hierarchy intention to them. In a ways, the internet is sort of like this taken to an extreme where we're all trying to live in the cloud and deny our physicality.

So, you know, they had started on this train of thought, but they had started working with more neuroscientists and really, you know, got into how metaphors are embedded in neurons in your brain. It's very physical.

> And they found out so much of the way that we reason and think about the world in what we would consider our logical way is spatial. And it's completely linked to our bodies and our emotions. And there is no, you know, there is no separation of mind and body is like the punchline.
