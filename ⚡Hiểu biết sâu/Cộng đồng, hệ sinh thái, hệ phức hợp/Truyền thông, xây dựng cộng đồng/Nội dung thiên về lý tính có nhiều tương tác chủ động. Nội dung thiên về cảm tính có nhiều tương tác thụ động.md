Managers can benefit from the insights provided by this study in multiple ways. First,results provide important implications regarding the strategic design and delivery of socialmedia content. Managers should include informational content within social media posts toincrease active SMEBs in the form of likes and shares. Users are also likely to passivelyconsume informational content by clicking on, reading, viewing, and consuming the content.Comparatively, remunerative content will result in active SMEB in the form of sharing andliking, although it does not facilitate any passive SMEB. Managers wishing to increase thenumber of shares should use monetary incentives within content. However, this form ofcontent will not influence passive SMEB.

To increase passive engagement such as viewing of photos, watching videos, and reading/processing of content, managers should employ entertaining and relational content. While manymanagers may expect that highly entertaining content is likely to be the most “viral” in terms ofincreasing likes, shares, and comments, this study’s findings demonstrate that this result is notthe case regarding the generation of shares and comments. Media users do not actively engage insharing and commenting despite their passive consumption of the content.
