Managers can benefit from the insights provided by this study in multiple ways. First, results provide important implications regarding the strategic design and delivery of social media content. Managers should include informational content within social media posts to increase active SMEBs in the form of likes and shares. Users are also likely to passively consume informational content by clicking on, reading, viewing, and consuming the content. Comparatively, remunerative content will result in active SMEB in the form of sharing and liking, although it does not facilitate any passive SMEB. Managers wishing to increase the number of shares should use monetary incentives within content. However, this form of content will not influence passive SMEB.

To increase passive engagement such as viewing of photos, watching videos, and reading/processing of content, managers should employ entertaining and relational content. While many managers may expect that highly entertaining content is likely to be the most “viral” in terms of increasing likes, shares, and comments, this study’s findings demonstrate that this result is not the case regarding the generation of shares and comments. Media users do not actively engage in sharing and commenting despite their passive consumption of the content.
