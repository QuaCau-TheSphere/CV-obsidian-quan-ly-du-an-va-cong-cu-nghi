Classifying is a central activity in object-oriented programming and distinguishes it from procedural programming. Traditional logic, initiated by Aristotle, assigns classification to our first activity in reasoning, whereby we come to know what a thing is. Such a grasp of the thing's whatness is the foundation for all further reasoning about it.
