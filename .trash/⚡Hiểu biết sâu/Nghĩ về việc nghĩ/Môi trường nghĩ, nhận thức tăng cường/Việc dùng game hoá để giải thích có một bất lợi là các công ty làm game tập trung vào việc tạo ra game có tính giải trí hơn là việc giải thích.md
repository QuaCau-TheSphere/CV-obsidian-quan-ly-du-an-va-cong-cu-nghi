One problem with educational games lies in the word "games". Video game companies have created an extremely successful business model which aligns very well with the goal of providing entertainment, and somewhat less well with the goal of providing great explanations. Inevitably, the business model sometimes conflicts with the goal of great explanation. When that happens it is not surprising that the game companies prioritize their business, at the expense of the quality of explanation. To put it another way, when the goal of explanation comes in conflict with the goal of creating a good game, the more successful game companies go with creating a good game.
