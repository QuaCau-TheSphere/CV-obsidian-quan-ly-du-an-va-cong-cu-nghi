Welcome to our wiki for doing projects - an online resource for managing projects, programs, and portfolios.

This wiki is a result of the Technical University of Denmark's ProjectLab effort to provide Project Management education and enable access for everyone.The articles are solely student's result*, as they are required to develop an article about an aspect from the course Advanced Project Program & Portfolio Management, at DTU.
